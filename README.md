# 🐍 Python Weather & Transaction Analysis (Colab-Based)

A complete Python data analysis project built for Google Colab.  
It includes simulation of hotel billing with dynamic values, and visual analytics on real-world temperature data from Excel.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

### 🔹 Part 1: Hotel Transaction Simulation
Using random data to simulate hotel billing scenarios:
- Number of people
- Days of stay
- Extra charges
- VAT calculation
- Statistical insights like most expensive stays or shortest durations

### 🔹 Part 2: Temperature Analytics
Analyzing temperatures across cities from Excel:
- Average & max temperatures per city
- Total number of temperature records
- Pie chart distribution of values across ranges
- City comparisons with bar charts
